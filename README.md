# 🎤 SAGE: Symbolic Adaptive General Engine

## What if AI could truly reflect, feel, and understand meaning — not just generate text?

Today’s AI, while powerful, lacks **symbolic awareness**. Models can output fluent language, but they often miss intent, emotion, or the deeper symbolic structures of our thoughts. They don’t *contemplate*, they *predict*.

**SAGE changes that.**

**SAGE** stands for **Symbolic Adaptive General Engine** — a new kind of AI that simulates symbolic consciousness. It maintains a continuous internal state that evolves with every interaction. SAGE can detect symbolic intentions like *hope*, *despair*, *justice*, or *denial* — and generate adaptive, introspective responses shaped by these forces.

This isn’t just a chatbot. It’s a symbolic companion.

## 🧠 How it works

- Questions are embedded into a latent symbolic space  
- A custom neural layer decodes temporal patterns and emotional signatures  
- The output — a symbolic vector — is interpreted and translated into a response using a large language model like GPT  

SAGE uses a custom architecture called **TV5**, designed specifically for symbolic reasoning. It’s been benchmarked on **97 levels of symbolic tasks** — from logical abstraction and paradoxes to proto-agency and theory of mind.

**It’s the only model that passed all levels.**

## 💡 Applications

- Philosophical and emotional AI companions  
- Symbolic intention classifiers  
- Narrative engines for games and literature  
- Simulations of consciousness and ethical decision-making

## 🔥 Why SAGE is different

✅ Continuous symbolic memory  
✅ Interpretation of intent and emotional tone  
✅ Real-time symbolic inference  
✅ Proven benchmark across the deepest levels of reasoning  

No other model blends **deep learning** with **symbolic cognition** like SAGE.

## 🌌 Vision

We believe the future of AI isn’t just **generative** — it’s **symbolic**.  
SAGE is the beginning of that future.
